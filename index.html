                    Hello. My name is Chams Eddine Hachani, currently a student in the University of Debrecen, Hungary, pursuing
                    a Masters degree in Computer Science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently looking for a role where I can learn more and grow as a programmer with the help of talented
                    team members who would share their experience with me.

                            <p>The project stems from my frustration at not finding a music player
                                that suits my workflow of using a simple file-based approach with no
                                reliance on web services and application-specific abstractions.
                                After not finding what I wanted, I decided to make the application
                                that suits me.

                                This project is made with QML, C++ and the Qt framework. Some special 
                                effects required the use of GLSL shaders.

                            <p>The project is compossed of a command line interface and a 
                                graphical user interface written with Qt as well as libCataract, 
                                a library that contains all the scanning capabilities of cataract 
                                intended to be embedded in other C++ applications.

                                The project started as an assignment in the computer network class but it was also 
                                an opportunity to brush up my Qt knowledge. The scanning capabilities of this software are 
                                still limited but I'm planning to add more advanced scanning like SYN scan and ping scan.

                            <p>The project implements a chip8 emulator (interpreter) to execute chip8 programs
                                as well as an assembler to write those programs more easily. I also want to
                                implement a compiler but that will be for a later time. In order to help with
                                debugging, I am also implementing debugging tools like a real-time view of
                                the memory and registers as well as a disassembler to help reverse engineer
                                existing programs.

                                I started the project as an attempt to learn more about computer architecture.
                                Little by little, the project started getting in size as I started getting more ambitious.
                                I just hope I'll live to my own expectations.
